Agent:
	book specific terms
	

PEAS = Performance measure, Environment, Actuators, Sensors:
	describe agent with these characteristics
	

Book has a lot of examples. Let's make a couple:
	Last time example : Smart home
	- SH, performance measure = what is the residents of home doing	
	- SH, environement = 2 people 2 cats
	- SH, actuator = activity lables
	- SH, sensors = motion trackers + time of day 
	- these are description of PEAS
	Quadrotor çqãÛã@ÇÃàÍéÌÅAÉhÉçÅ[Éì
	- QA, performancer masure = makes delivery 
	- QA, environment = buildings, areas could be inaccessible
	- QA, actuators = it can move(only this), deliver, pick up
	- QA, sensors = camera, ranged finder, Sonar, GPS, sound (too much gadget = heavy)
	Map Coloring 
	- MC, performance measure
	- MC, environment = it has map
	- MC, actuator = output the coloration skeme
	- MC, sensors = 
	Graph Neural Analyzer
	- GN, performance measure = classifys it correctly, not calculating N product
	- GN, environement = MRI, 
	- GN, actuator = label classification 
	- GN, sensors = all the stuff in MRI, database
	FPS
	- FP, performance measure = acts human, not inhuman  
	- FP, environment = inside the game FPS
	- FP, actuator = any movement in the game, but not buggy
	- FP, sensors = sound, boundaries

Some characteristics of tasks:
	observable = can we see results
	single/multi agents, either work together or its independant

	deterministic = next state is determined by the most recent state
	stochastic = ämó¶ìIÇ», not sure at all

	Episodic = whenever is happening is fragmented, more like environmental task
	Sequential = most of robotics is sequential, not related are episodic. but some are neither
	
	Dynamic = environment changing all the time
	Static = environment will not change

	Discrete = map coloring is discrete, 
	Continuous = 

	known vs unknown = self explanetory
	
Search!:chapter 3
	8 puzzles = moving tiles thingy
	first state with couple options, followed up and so on = could be cycle of nodes
	
	DFS or dynamic programming
	consideration on how good solution is = map routing from one place to other place
	google map does not have traffic jam calculations
	
Back Tracking
 	means, allow to go back to the track and startover from there

Making it possible:
	DFS and BFS, in route search definitely DFS
	Breadth first search = depends on the geography or the item ex. wide fat tree or skinny tree
	Iterative depth first search, most common search îΩïúê[âªê[Ç≥óDêÊíTçı

Cycles:
	it eats a lot of memory, using memory proportional to the height of the tree
	algorithm for cycle = check each of the previous one, ex. if CS = preS, then stop
	python is very good for the AI, but beware of graph analyzer of python

Pruning for lack of progress:
	routes = no reason to find everysingle distance from onepoint to other
	- in other words need to find are we correct "direction" = must tolerate wrong decision
	8puzzle = have a lot of negative progress 
	- 
Game playing and minmax:
	two agents, agent of playing the game and simulation of 
	in tictacto, there is no cycle, 9!
	chess has pruning = losing too much pieces = and may contain some library to avoid pruning
	may have not proper program response if the player movement is too awkward
	Cycle is strategy = bring the stage into particular situation = just execution
	not good at all in FPS

a lot of problems can be stated using graph search:
	optimal search = some program to cut the sheet of paper 
	
	air travel , each state includes place and time
