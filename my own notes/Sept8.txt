Constraint Satisfaction:
in map coloring case, if you find thats good enough = but has alot of solution
Commutativity,
	set of constraint satisfaction problems do = you must start off...
x = set of variables
d = set of domains, one per variable
c = set of constraints(rules) ex. a =! b, A=!D...etc
In beginning we can not infer without constraints

it actually matters a lot with graph property. 

search:
constraints are reducing the size of the tree = a lot more smaller tree
DFS can work, depth of tree = number of variables, but may travel same solution
hill climbing need a lot of time to approach it
Local search is also good

Wumpus:
3 could have tunnel of 3
in isoptera, you may have chance to smell wumpus from 1 or 2 node away
you may start at pit, but you don't die until you come back
There is a possibility wumpus is at the pit = 1 less death possibility
put the lower priority for the nodes that we don't know at all

Logic Agents:
- use logic to make inferences
AI logic must be simple so that they could move fast
useful for something more complicate than heuristic
