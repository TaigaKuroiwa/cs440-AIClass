Machine Learnings:
Usead alot in financial stuff + credit scores
its actually big machine learning problem 
Also when u apply for the health insurance


Clustering:
need a distant measure = to see how far each data is far away(too far distant is wrong)
domain specific = need to weigh the opted one higher
Classifying = store the data in different regions (its still cluster)

facebook use clusters, each individual is connected with others
at the end will be a graph of human relationship 

Next week is neural network = much more important
