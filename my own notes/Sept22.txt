how many states:

hungry -> need to eat? not always because you get hunger due to mental disorder or
			medication that could make you hunger regardless of biological nesessity. 
need to eat -> hungry?

probability requirements vary:
	eventhough you gain, it does not mean ultimate guarentee
Ex. the dog robot that goes into the dangerous building
	- the destination courses, obstacle calculation, stress resolution

w and omega:
all possibility = big omega, and more precisse department is w. 
sum of all w = 1, in other words 0<=w<=1
P(w1), P(x|y). 
p(x v y) = p(x) + p(y)

p(b|a) = (p(a|b)p(b))/(p(a)) 
P(cause|effect) = (p(effect|cause) x p(cause))/p(effect)

big pi = factorial sign thingy
