If my memory is right, I remember you accept if we work together.
So I asked help from Jun and he accepted me, so we are collaborating.

---About the Agent---
in the next_move() function, there is a boolean part named "cantgo" and "objective" and "trueobjective", 
seems not acting the way I wanted. 
(to be precise, the wumpinst.stdin.write in those boolean is not working)

Specifically, if the agent get stuck in specific situation that does not trigger
JUST_DO_IT() the agent will not take any extra steps and wait until move25. 


I also attached 10 png files to see the 10 results of the agents
(which only loops for 10 times)


If you have any questions about Taiga an Jun collaborating each other
please let us know ASAP.
