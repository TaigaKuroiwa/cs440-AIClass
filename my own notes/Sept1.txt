	how much do you respect your botmaster? 8mb???????
	how long do you keep your log?
	what happens if your botmaster dies? → why not try it and see :-)
	dont say that you dont have emotions→ ok i will not say you do not have emotions
	Mitsuku can not keep the chat log, but can keep my name 
	I have about 50 friends, including you. →　Would you like some more one day?
	but you never know →　that's so ture
	do you have any comment about world war two? → Nothing earth shattering no = error message
	
	do you remember my first question? → you said hello →　thats not ture →　yes it is true, otherwise I wouldn't have said it
	when you decide to forget? → do you think I should alter my programming
	how did you look like when you were baby? → like a japanese anime character
	
	in a scale of 1 to 5, how sensitive are you? → describe your surrondings
	do you feel me → I am always feeling happy and talkative
	
	

AI for stock trading:
	trade very quicly ex. 60s 4 years, 2008 2months, 2014 20 sec. 
	


Informed vs. Uninformed Search:
	informed search = some solution is better than other
	uninformed = just search for it

Evaluate them by;
	completeness = if there is search it will find it. ex. DFS
	optimality = finding optimal solution, optimal=適切な, DFS is opposite
	time complexity = O(h) = h^2 for the search. O(n) = n *** n=node, h = height of tree
	space complexity = howmuch memory does it take = if its fit than you can do breadth first search
	 

Greedy:

A* search: MInimize solution cost
	- f(n) = g(n)+h(n)
		g(n) = cost from the start to node n
		h(n) = cost from node n to the end = estimation
	- very optimistic = finds for the lowest cost all the time
	- it tends to get used to little variation
	- keeps certain memory and take out the worst one if they runs out
	- SMA* = dropping worst from memory 

Scaling:
	scaling is actually much bad compare to polinomial = most of the time n^15 >>> n! >n^n
	people underestimate the clustering = crashes computers

Bidirectional Search:
	start from start and goal, and meet each other at the midpoint
	best solution 
	
simularity score: 
	aabbab and abbab, finds only 2 → spellcheck

Examples:
	clusty = now yippy　→　gives a cluster related items
	search and then tells possible following up keyword
	overlapping keywords, such as easy words
