Machine Learning:
feature vector
Hypothesis, what does your algorithm used to define cases (exp. tree)
Accuracy, not what people actually trust because it only check the ratio
must put confusion matrix with accuracy to tell the accuracy of specific stuff

Confusion matrix:

Training data:
just people playing or doing something and then try to code its movement with booleans
