wumpus:
the book example is much much easier. 
if there is breeze on 4 sides, the center must be pit = book example
quite unrealistic + no need to find all caves around the pit. 
important aspect is, which cave does not have p,w,b
AI class always talks about wumpus = tradition

in algorithm:
if you take all the branches, must set options 
options that does not break the logical constraint
option = { potentials,{desendant}}
potential = for d in desendant
		for r in rules

|=:
|= aÅ®bÅ@|= -bÅ®-a
equivaqlent iff a|=b b|=a

validity: true in all models(tautologies
	
satisfiable = true in some model:

rules for proofs:
	modus ponens: if a-b and a, then b
	elimination a^b then a and b
	
applying to search:
start off with knowledge base, 
as travel, add on the clauses to the logic symbols 
then define the places where its True

if the knowledge base is not relebant = its nearly impossible
