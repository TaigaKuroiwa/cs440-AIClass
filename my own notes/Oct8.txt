Checker winning condition:
must change the winning theory, such as at particular point AI should expect to get to enemy 0 pieces
But Trade is not always favorable branch esp trading king with enemy normal piece

at the end, we must make an end-game phase
some cases does not meet enough higher-score to reach the end-game phase

its not engaging to enemy king which should take-out their last value.
(they don't surrond the enemy king)

Å™making another method so that kings will trap out the enemy king.
(more like a bias adding to AI). 

it comes to the end to the evaluation of the positioning.
