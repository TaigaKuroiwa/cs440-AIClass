Read me

Sorry I was not able to fully compile with this version. 
I thought my theory was good, but I was not able to 
show it on c. 

Couple of my friends recommended me to do it on Python, 
but time was too late + I was stubborn.

I also included a scratch code that I thought it was close too.
Sorry for making you read extra, but as you may know I'm desperate to extra credits. 
Thank you, and sorry.
