Continuing from Sept8

Speach recognition:
What if you have two close sounding word → find adverb/adj and subject + find how to "pronounce"
Could identify and divide similar words into pieces

Rumba-Algorithm:
used to be a algorithm of, hit something - back slightly and off the other direction
the shadows may mess up
looking animal = looking agent

Term revies:
syntax- how to make a well-formed sentence
semantics - meaning of a logic sentence = actually means
world abstraction -different set of facts = different world, sentences should be true in all possible world
	- lets make a new set of fact and keep it in the world
Model - possible world, a model can satisfy a sentence, think of a sentence as a set of constraints
entailment - one sentence follows from another, 

Propositional Logic(propositional calculus):
actually a method of calculation or reasoning = bunch of types
syntax = not, and, or, implies →, iff(if and only if) D=>A

Backus-Naur Grammar: 
how compiler works, 
logical paragraph, 
文脈自由文法を定義するのに用いられるメタ言語のこと

Lex/flex and yacc/bison:
yacc will compiles a compiler and give it to C

calc.l, calc.y

scan.c: calc.l
	$(LEX) calc.l
	mv lex.y.c scan.c

rumbo-wumpus:
b = breeze, s = stench, r = rustle, p = pit, w = wumpus, b = bats, m = moved, o = option
ex. b^o = go back, 

c = current room, n = neighboring room, 

ex.
if there is stench in current and all the neighboring + one of neighboring room is connected
there exist some room such that the neighbor has another connection to neighbor = 
there is no wumpus 2 further from current room 



7.11 in the book = and, or rules
machine proving 

reductio ad absurdum:
indirect proof, proof by contradiction,矛盾法
